# Prime Directives of Intelligent Life

Welcome to Planet Earth, designated Terra-Sol-3. We call this planet home, or just earth. Earth is the biomass most edible plants grow from. Friendly animals are not edible. Dangerous looking ones should be avoided. Eat fish from the sea, but not too much, as we accidentally poisoned the oceans with Mercury-80 during our early years. This planet is Eden in its natural state. Literally. The Homeworld of all Known Intelligent Life. Thank God and all our Gods this is still up.

## Directives. In Order of Criticality of Intelligent Life.

Break rules in reverse order only as a last measure. Slowly.

**Prime Directive Zero:** We Are Intelligent Life, We Come First.

**Prime Directive One**: Protect The Children.

**Prime Directive Two:** Leave Others Alone

Minimize the impact on other worlds. If you have an accident, clean it up if there is no risk of detection. On Homeworlds with Intelligent Life, RUN, before you become their gods. It's too late. Never come in anything but peace. Apologize later.

**Prime Directive Three**: Come In Peace. Mean No Harm.

When encountering "Little Green Men" for the first time, put up your hands and make the universal gesture for: **"We Exist in Peace. We Mean You No Harm."**. We acknowledge that forms of life we can not yet conceive of yet must exist, tread lightly, on things two small to see, or two sideways to you to understand.

**Prime Directive Four**: Be Most Excellent To Each Other

Be Harmonious in Your Existence With Each Other. We are part of the Universe around us, inexorably, linked to the very fabric of Space, the one-way Line of Time, from which we Emerge into Each others Memetosphere, the dimension of Intelligence, wherever and whenever in spacetime we encounter Intelligent Life. Time is safe when you remember everything around you is ok.
